# IMP API UI
UI is part of the IMP project. The IMP project allows you to produce, visualize and consume your OWN RESTful services. 
No proxy or 3rd party services required. Do it your own way.

IMP UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation and sandbox from a IMP API. Because 
IMP UI has no dependencies, you can host it in any server environment, or on your local machine.
